public class BookAllocationProblem {
    /*

    Given an array of integers A of size N and an integer B.

The College library has N books. The ith book has A[i] number of pages.

You have to allocate books to B number of students so that the maximum number of pages allocated to a student is minimum.

A book will be allocated to exactly one student.
Each student has to be allocated at least one book.
Allotment should be in contiguous order, for example: A student cannot be allocated book 1 and book 3, skipping book 2.
Calculate and return that minimum possible number.

NOTE: Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible.

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i], B <= 105



Input Format
The first argument given is the integer array A.
The second argument given is the integer B.



Output Format
Return that minimum possible number.



Example Input
A = [12, 34, 67, 90]
B = 2


Example Output
113


Example Explanation
There are two students. Books can be distributed in following fashion :

1)  [12] and [34, 67, 90]
    Max number of pages is allocated to student 2 with 34 + 67 + 90 = 191 pages
2)  [12, 34] and [67, 90]
    Max number of pages is allocated to student 2 with 67 + 90 = 157 pages
3)  [12, 34, 67] and [90]
    Max number of pages is allocated to student 1 with 12 + 34 + 67 = 113 pages
    Of the 3 cases, Option 3 has the minimum pages = 113.
