                                                      STACK
Kotlin doesn't have a built-in Stack class,
                            but
you can use collections like MutableList, ArrayDeque, or LinkedList to implement stack functionality.

Among these, ArrayDeque is preferred because it is more efficient due to its optimized double-ended queue implementation.

                                            ArrayDeque

    ArrayDeque in Kotlin (and Java) is a double-ended queue that allows elements
    to be added or removed from both ends efficiently.

    It is implemented as a resizable array and is part of the Kotlin Collections framework.

    In Kotlin, ArrayDeque is a flexible and efficient choice for implementing stacks or queues due to
    its constant time complexity (O(1)) for most operations.


    Key Features of ArrayDeque
        1. Dynamic Resizing
            Automatically resizes its internal array when full, ensuring efficient use of memory.

        2. Efficient Operations
            Additions and removals from both ends (front and rear) are
            O(1) in most cases.

        3. Non-Synchronized
            ArrayDeque is not thread-safe. If thread safety is required, external synchronization is necessary.
