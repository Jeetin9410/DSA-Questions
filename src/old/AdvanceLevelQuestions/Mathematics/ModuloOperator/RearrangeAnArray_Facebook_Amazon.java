    /*
    Given an array arr[] of size n where every element is in the range from 0 to n-1.
    Rearrange the given array so that arr[i] becomes arr[arr[i]].
    This should be done with O(1) extra space.

     Input: arr[]  = {3, 2, 0, 1}
    Output: arr[] = {1, 0, 3, 2}
    Explanation:
    In the given array
    arr[arr[0]] is 1 so arr[0] in output array is 1
    arr[arr[1]] is 0 so arr[1] in output array is 0
    arr[arr[2]] is 3 so arr[2] in output array is 3
    arr[arr[3]] is 2 so arr[3] in output array is 2

    Input: arr[] = {4, 0, 2, 1, 3}
    Output: arr[] = {3, 4, 2, 0, 1}
    Explanation:
    arr[arr[0]] is 3 so arr[0] in output array is 3
    arr[arr[1]] is 4 so arr[1] in output array is 4
    arr[arr[2]] is 2 so arr[2] in output array is 2
    arr[arr[3]] is 0 so arr[3] in output array is 0
    arr[arr[4]] is 1 so arr[4] in output array is 1
