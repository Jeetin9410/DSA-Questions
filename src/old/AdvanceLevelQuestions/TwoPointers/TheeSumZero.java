    /*
    Given an array A of N integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0

Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:

Elements in a triplet (a,b,c) must be in non-descending order.
 (ie, a ≤ b ≤ c) The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

 0 <= N <= 7000

-10^8 <= A[i] <= 10^8

Example Input

A = [-1,0,1,2,-1,4]


Example Output

[ [-1,0,1],
  [-1,-1,2] ]


Example Explanation

Out of all the possible triplets having total sum zero,only the above two triplets are unique.
