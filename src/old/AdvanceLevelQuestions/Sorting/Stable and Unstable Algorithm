Ques : What is stability in algorithm?
Ans:   Stability in sorting algorithm stands for the property of that sorting algorithm to maintain the relative order
       of items with same values.

---> Stable Sorting Algorithm :

 Stable sorting algorithm maintains the relative order of the items with equal sort keys.
 An unstable sorting algorithm does not. In other words, when a collection is sorted with a stable sorting algorithm,
 items with the same sort keys preserve their order after the collection is sorted.

 Example :  Sorting by Grade , Highest first
                Before
         Name            Grade                 Name            Grade
         Dave              C                   Fabian            A
         Earl              B                   Greg              A
         Fabian            A       --->        Harry             A
         Gill              B                   Earl              B
         Greg              A                   Gill              B
         Harry             A                   Dave              C

         Observation :
          After sorting
            For A  Fabian , Greg and Harry
            For B as well  Earl and gill are in same order.

    This trend means that this sorting algorithm is stable.

 ---> Unstable Sorting Algorithm

 Example :  Sorting by Name , Alphabetically
                 Before
          Name            Grade              Name             Grade
          Fabian            A                Dave               C
          Greg              A                Earl               B
          Harry             A     --->       Fabian             A
          Earl              B                Gill               B
          Gill              B                Greg               A
          Dave              C                Harry              A

          here Gill and Greg are not in the same order before and after

          This is unstable sorting algorithm.


          Here are a few common sorting algorithms and their stability:

          Insertion Sort — Stable
          Selection Sort — Unstable
          Bubble Sort — Stable
          Merge Sort — Stable
          Shell Sort — Unstable
          Timsort — Stable
