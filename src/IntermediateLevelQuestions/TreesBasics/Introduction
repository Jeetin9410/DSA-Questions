    *************************************** Tree Data Structure *************************************************

    The data structure is a specialized method to organize and store data in the computer to be used more effectively.
    There are various types of data structures, such as stack, linked list, and queue, arranged in sequential order.
    For example, a linked data structure consists of a set of nodes that are linked together by links or points.

    Similarly, the tree data structure is a kind of hierarchical data arranged in a tree-like structure.
     It consists of a central node, structural nodes, and sub nodes, which are connected via edges.
      We can also say that tree data structure has roots, branches, and leaves connected with one another.

    A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of
     the tree stores a value, a list of references to nodes (the “children”)

     ****************************  Why Tree Data Structure? ******************************************************

     Other data structures such as arrays, linked list, stack, and queue are linear data structures that store data
     sequentially.
     In order to perform any operation in a linear data structure, the time complexity increases with the increase
     in the data size.
     But, it is not acceptable in today's computational world.

     Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure.

     ********************************************* Terminologies **************************************************

        Root :
        It is the topmost node of a tree.

        Height of a Node :
        The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf (ie. the longest path from the node to a leaf node).

        Depth of a Node :
        The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.

        Height of a Tree :
        The height of a Tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.
