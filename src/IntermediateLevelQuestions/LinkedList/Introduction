   Ques : What is LinkedList
   Ans :  Unlike Arrays, LinkedList is also a linear data structure.
          Unlike Arrays, LinkedList elements are not stored at a contiguous location, the element are linked using pointers.
                                                    OR
          LinkedList is a collection of Objects called nodes linked with pointer, where the nodes are randomly stored in
          the memory.
          A Node contains two fields ----> 1) Data field i.e (int,float,double,String or any type of data)
                                     ----> 2) Pointer that contains address of next node in the memory.


   Ques : Representation of Node

   Ans :
        class LinkedList{

            class Node {

                int data;
                Node next;

                Node(int data){
                this.data = data;
                next = null;
                }

            }

        }


        Visual implementation :


        ________________
        |          |   |
        |  data    |  --------> Null
        |__________|___|


        }


Linked List Complexity:
Time Complexity
Time Complexity	   Worst Case	  Average Case
Search             	O(n)	        O(n)
Insert	            O(1)	        O(1)
Deletion	        O(1)	        O(1)
